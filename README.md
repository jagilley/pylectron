# pylectron
An electron.js GUI wrapper for arbitrary Python scripts

# Motivation
Python is unparalleled in certain domains and is the de facto lingua franca for many types of applications, but its GUI-building modules have always seemed suspect in their versatility/extensibility. Hence, the need for a better way to build GUIs that run Python on the backend.

# Implementation
Pylectron is a simple Electron wrapper on a series of Python scripts. It features automatic virtual environment management, in order to allow developers to focus solely on building what's important.
